# Overview

To expand my programming knowledge I am learning 2 new languages, cloud databases, SQL relational databases, data analysis, and beginner game development. I am undertaking these projects so I can become a valuable and attractive employee, which will help me get a stimulating career and provide for my (eventual) family, and hopefully get into game development.

This is a beginning assignment to get me acquainted with creating a software portfolio and pushing code to Github.
It imports a function from the random library, prints a message, and then prints a statement a random amount of times using a for loop, range function, and randint function.

# Development Environment

I used Microsoft Visual Studio Code as my integrated development environment and code editor for creating this program.

I used python as it is a language I am familiar and comfortable with. Plus none of the hassle with setting up C# project files.
